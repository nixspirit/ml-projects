    "Principal component analysis is a method often used for tasks such as face recognition. In this notebook, we implement PCA along with a kNN classifier in order to perform face recognition. You are given the code separated in cells and explained throughout. Your task is simply to read the code, execute the cells, and observe the results. This code was based to some extent on the scikit-learn example on performing similar methods on faces.\n"
